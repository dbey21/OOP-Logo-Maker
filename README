#  Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker

## Description

The objective of the project was to create a command-line application that takes in user input to generates a logo and saves it as an SVG file.

The application includes Triangle, Circle, and Square classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. 

Each shape class is tested for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.
